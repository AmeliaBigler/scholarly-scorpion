# Social Network API

## Description

This NoSQL social network API can be used by social media developers as a back end for a social media app.
This API includes routes to create, read, update, and delete user information, user posts (aka "thoughts") and comments on posts (aka "reactions"). 

This app uses the Express.js and Mongoose packages.

The app's functionality can be tested in the insomnia program, as seen in the following video demo:
